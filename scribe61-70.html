</P>
<P>
This was a run that was set by Wanda and a refugee from the Kyoto Hash,
Momi (unnamed thus far!). The general opinion of ten or so Moon-runners
this was our best hash in recent memory. We were sent by the hares on a
great journey through the Arashiyama tourist sights. The run weaved in
and out picturesque temples that at times included dodging cars, rickshaws,
and the very large tourist crowd. The beauty of Arashiyama lived up to
it's reputation with the leaves changing colors to mark the coming of fall,
as well as, fashionable young women in mini-shirts out for stroll. After
an hour of hashing, Triathlon Bob was up in front of the pack sprinting
toward home, when the Moon Master and Slimie Limie called for this veteran
hasher to stop for a Moon Check. Having an rebellious streak since he was
a young lad, he ignored the call and ran On-Home ensued shortly thereafter
by the rest of our hash. He claimed he &quot;wanted a beer&quot;. Due to
this brash behavior, he was given a down-down! A number of down-downs began
with the circle and the mood was set for the On-In. It was held in small
place which we totally took over and turned out to be rowdy affair. Our
behavior was generally loud and disorderly true to hash tradition. Lastly,
A "virgin hasher" named Imamura-kun was finally given his hash name,
IKU-IKKAI! Some time later in the evening, swing low followed, and we made
it back to our homes until the next moon run. A Great Day! A Great Hash!
On-On!

On this beautiful Sunday afternoon we met at JR Sanda and waited for
quite some time and eventually eight hashers showed up. Oddly, Wanda and
Slimie Limie were no where to be found. I just figured they were sent on
pretty long CB. The one way run to Miki's new house took a little more
than and hour to complete, with some well disguised check-backs. We started
off zigzagging north of the station along a river only to miraculously
discover the Pig Couple out on the course looking lost and very confused!
At least they did the &quot;legwork&quot; for the first check! Semen took
them aside and explained a few things about the hash which have remained
a secret. The course took us through small farming plots, bamboo groves
and some new housing developments.
</P>
<P>
Later, Wanda and Slimie Limie showed up carrying their bags over the
course and looked exhausted. Some down-downs were given out and after some
they recovered. The highlights of this Hash was the BBQ that Miki and Sukebe
made and Semen's gift of the gab with all that last well into the evening.
Another great hash! On-On!

The advertisement for Ulysses Osaka-Port run said it would be creative
and possibly involve an aeroplane. 'Submarine' I think would have been
more appropriate. When are we going to change this guy's name to 'Ame-otoko'?
Seven hashers, Wanda, Nagoya H3's Mother Duck, Penisonic, Chinko Manko,
GFL, Foreskin (formerly "Lost'n'Found" - ask a KH3 runner why
the name change!) and your scribe met at a chilly Chuo- sen Osaka-ko station
around 3pm. Not a hare or arrow-to-start to be seen. The area was already
wet but then it started to rain again... At 3:30 a wet and bedraggled Ulysses
came running into the station looking exhausted. "I'm sorry",
he managed to gasp between ragged breaths, "I got lost - the run took
4 hours to set, maybe it's too long". Seconds later several hashers
manhandled me back off the homewards-heading train. The run started two
station further down the newly extended line at Cosmo Square Station. This
is as bleak an open area as you might find on a man-made island where few
buildings have yet been erected. Sure enough the wind was blowing hard,
and as we set off a squall showered the entire pack with ice-cold rain.
That was it, cold and soaked to the shreadies in the first 25 metres! Actually,
for the conditions the trail was marked remarkably well. Flour was still
visable but chalk long gone. Made checks interesting - run 'til you loose
flour then come back - hope 'On-On' is in flour! The run went south along
the route of the Sky-Tram tracks then curved Eastwards back to Osaka-ko.
This meant crossing water three times. Oh the bridges, the bridges... These
were monsters, high enough to let ships under. Hence almost in the clouds,
rain and howling wind on this foul day. At the end of the second there
was a circular off-ramp. Three complete revolutions to ground level. At
least it was warmer down there. Especially running through the petro-chemical
processing plant. I think I now know where they filmed 'Bladerunner'. The
final bridge faced a populated area so had the Moon-Check. No Sun-Bunning
today! I managed to raise my shorts a crack. Can't imagine anybody was
looking out of their window to appreciate the sight. Shortly after I saw
a strange figure battling towards me, struggling with an umbrella. Ulysses!
nice of him to come out and meet us! I lacked the stength to throw him bodily
off the bridge, so instead asked "how many K to the beer?". "Not
K", he replied, "Only 500 metres". Music! Why are hares
compulsive liars? Must have been another one and a half K 'til I saw the
welcome sight of Osaka-ko station. Penisonic was already back, and other
hares returned over the next five minutes. But no GFL or Duck. Fifteen
minutes later Ulysses went searching again, and of course five minutes
later the two missing hashers showed up - by bus! Down-Down! Having collected
the gallant Ulysses the pack retired to Bentencho for the On-In. A notable
place for it's decor - explicit to say the least and on an errr... sexual
theme. Interesting 'cave' in the gent's toilet. Apparently a detailed daikon-like
protuberence in the ladies. Must go back there again some time. Like to
re-do that run in the summer maybe, the views from the bridges must be
stunning! On-On

On this beautiful, windy Saturday afternoon I ran into Beaver, Queen
Mother, Slimie Limie waiting on the platform the way to our destination,
Nagaoka Tenjin. I was little worried about being on time and waited for
quite some time and eventually over twenty so hashers showed up.(Or was
it closer to thirty?) It was good to see Flash, Hand Job, Triathlon Bob
and Mother Theresa back from holidays in the America. Oddly, Wanda and
Etch were no where to be found. Later they just showed with Wanda cover
with flour and Etch looking like he came down from some mountain. I began
to worry. Was this going to be another two hour run? This joint run was
to celebrate run number 69 run from both KyotoH3 and KFMH3 . To mark this
occasion some colorful T-shirts were made. As we took off on the north
side of the station we through some public park with a very large pond.
The perfect place for a Moon Check! Futatabi's attempt was less than satisfactory
and earned her a Down-Down! The run lead us through quiet neighborhoods,
bamboo groves and rice fields took a little more than and hour to complete.
We finally zigzagging back to a small park for the circle. Beaver came
prancing in and the story that was relayed to me, in the bamboo forest
some local authority told him he could not &quot;walk in this area&quot;.
Therefore, this veteran hasher who has his moments, promptly began to run!
After a number of Down-Downs were bestowed upon some hashers for their
offenses and sins, we off to the public bath. The Hash took over the place
to the dismay of the locals. When Wanda tried to climb over the wall is
set the mood for the On-In......................It was a blur after that.
A special thanks to Etch &amp; Wanda for the great course &amp; Slimie
Limie for helping &quot;behind the scenes&quot; all their efforts to make
this special day a success. A fantastic Hash on a remarkable day! On-On!

The day before the Hashing Day, I got the e-mail from Nagoya Hasher
Hot Tuna. The title (reference) of the e-mail was &quot;Tomorrow is Takatsuki,
isn't it??&quot; and the contents were &quot;I am planning to come to join
KFMH3, because my schedule for tomorrow was canceled, so, I want to use
my time to visit Kansai and join you&quot;. &quot;WHAT??? From Nagoya??
For the USUAL RUN??? He comes to Takatsuki??! Is he OK?? Must be a little
sick, but he is a good hasher!&quot; I wondered, however, glad to hear
that and thought that NEWT(former NH3 Hasher, now living in Kansai) might
be happy to hear this news. So, I sent the e-mail to NEWT soon in order
to inform him of Hot Tuna's GREAT PLAN.
</P>
<P>
On the Hashing Day, I went to JR Takatsuki Station, still wondering
if Hot Tuna will come today?? At the station, I saw BOB was walking around
North Exit with a lady who looked very strong. &quot;On-On&quot; I shout
at BOB. &quot;Hi! Wanda, Hisashiburi(=long time no see!), how are you doing?
This lady is a new comer, I met her at the Sports Gym and invited her to
our Hash. You know that she was a professional wrestler before!&quot; It's
no wonder that she looked very strong!
</P>
<P>
Then Slimie Limie (the hare) came back and NEWT turned up. So we went
down the stairs and got to the meeting place, a small square. Soon after,
an unexpected Hasher showed up! WHO?? It was Erection. Big surprise!! But
a happy surprise!! Then, Hot Tuna came from the opposite direction. What
he wrote in his E-mail was true. In addition, Slimie's previous student
came with her friend and Roxxoff &amp; Sweat Peecock and CM also arrived.
So, the group was quite big for the KFMH3. BANZAI!! Then, we started off.
</P>
<P>
First of all, we headed NORTH(??) and it was not long before coming
to the First Check, near a shrine, Slimie's favorite place. When he set
the run for KH3 before, he put the Check Point here!! (exactly the same
place!) At that time we took quite long time to find the true trail. But,
this time it was not so difficult to find the ON-ON. After the Check, a
loop was waiting for us. We enjoyed that loop many times. Some enjoyed
3 or 4 times. It was first time for Hot Tuna to have loop course, so he
enjoyed it more than others.
</P>
<P>
Then, we came to the foot of Mt.Takatsuki, which was named by Slimie
after running through some fields and residential quarter. At there, we
did &quot;moon the moon!&quot; together, except Hot Tuna who had no knowleadge
about Mooning and Erection who got lost.
</P>
<P>
After that, I don't know where we ran, but suddenly I found some familiar
places. It was the front of Slimie Limie's mansion. From there, On-Home
was very near, about 10 minutes. When I was waiting for other hashers at
On-Home, I saw Mother Theresa who had come late, running back. She had
run with her back-pack, because she came late and didn't know where she
could leave her bag. Otukare-sama!
</P>
<P>
Then, new comers and Erection who had lost sight of other hashers, finally
came back.
</P>
<P>
After giving DOWN-DOWNs to hashers for all the usual reasons, we went
to the IZAKAYA called &quot;MURASAKI&quot;, very comfortable place and
enjoyed lots of BEER and good food. After the ON-ON, so around 8:00pm,
some of us (NEWT, Hot Tuna, Slimie Limie and I) decided to have 2-jikai
at Slimie's place. We enjoyed some more BEER with bickies.
</P>
<P>
But, WHY did the enjoyable time pass so soon? We had to run to JR Takatsuki
Station in order to catch the train so Hot Tuna could catch the LAST Shinkansen
back to Nagoya! Next day, I had another e-mail from Hot-Tuna to say that
he managed to get back to his place, although without some memory! Thanks
for visiting our hash!
