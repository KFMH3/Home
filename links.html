Believe it or not, some hounds have lives other than The Hash.  
A most appalling waste of drinking/debauchery time and surely a 
Down-Down offence!  Check 'em out first...

The "sometimes sensitive" hash. Re-awakened in 2012 after a 6 or 8 year 
hiatus (no-one knows the exact day or even year it died due to total lack of 
interest).

<FONT SIZE="+1">Osaka HHH</FONT>

Meets the last Saturday of each month within
the city limits of Osaka.  Being the middle of the weekend, it has been 
known to encourage all-night drinking.... Check KH3 Web site for next run.

Web site of the first hash in Japan, as well as hosting most of the kennels
in Tokyo.  Has a very useful A to Z of Hashes in Japan (though there's
neither A nor Z.  Resurrect Akita H3?  Create Zama H3?  Any volunteers?).

Where?  Pass me a map, I have no idea either...  "Only" 100 km from Tokyo apparently. 
Having most On-Ins at micro-breweries however, this has got to be a kennel worth 
visiting!

A kennel in Kyushu, who have their own Hash Mutt, "Koku"!  With Flounder Member 
sphincter out of action having badly broken his ankle (on trail while haring!) 
and Grand Master Sir Trots A Lot about to leave, others will be stepping 
forward soon to keep this fine hash afloat....

mug".  Check out the picture - Down-Down that sucker and you'd be good for the weekend!

Better known to hashers as "Slimie Limie", find out what he gets up to 
when not wearing those disgusting T-shirt/shorts/shoes combinations he's
so fond of.... Except that these days he's so busy with hash business that
his Web site became a cobweb....
