<P>
On that fateful day, Sunday November 24, there were
full [42 Km] and half [21 Km] marathon races held in Amagasaki. Since
there has never been a &quot;Full Marathon-race&quot; in Hanshin area before.
So, we, KFMH3, had planned to join and celebrate this event with some our
own &quot;moon madness&quot;. But .... only 4 hashers were there. Roxxxoff
for Full Marathon, Do-It-Now, Mr.Haccho, and I (Wanda) for Half-Marathon.
None of us could find the Moon Check. Despite this, All we could finish
the race without any problems.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the decision to have a run was made very suddenly, CM agreed
to set a run. So, I invited Do-It-Now and Haccho-san to KFMH3's run. The
Moon Master (Get Fuckin' Lost), Gobshite, Bob, and Dr. Dog Style came to
run. Moreover, Hiragana-Kanji was there, because of Master's eager invitation.
So, we could have some unexpected new runners.
</P>
<P>
For obvious reasons, the course was not so long, but we ran through
some fields and over the Mukogawa. This Hash turned on almost every corner
and was full of variety &amp; rather interesting! CM's creativity left
his signature on this run by having the Moon Check on a steep embankment
in front of a busy road. They are no shy ones on the Full Moon Hash! Just
ask around! It was very unfortunate for myself personally that I could
not join "ON-ON" because of very private reason: My Angry Mother!

Mikage has almost rebuilt itself with a number of changes. The neighborhood
again is quiet from the sounds of reconstruction. Gone are the jack- hammers
that greet the early morn, dump trucks that race here and there, and the
construction worker sleeping on the side of the road during their breaks.......
This was the promise from our Moon Master and his favorite, DESHI, Wanda-chan............
Mikage received a jolt when KINKY FULL HASHERS broke the peace with screams
of ON-ON and the roar of the HASH HORN!
</P>
<P>
Despite being windy cold day about ten hashers turned to the Full Moon
Hash..........It was a bright, beautiful day with a great view which began
to looked even better when Sweat Peacock showed up by placing her pretty
butt on a bicycle saddle. She recently bought a new mountain bike at good
price through a connections via BONSAI. Her bike looks light and strong.
She is claims she is about to starting trainning for &quot;Bike Hash&quot;.
Maybe, we can see the fruits of her efforts.
</P>
<P>
Other hashers arrive but didn't receive so much attention. Gobshite
came by his car and we were allowed to use his car to place our baggage
instead of locker. Nick, our Hash Horn, was practicing safe hashing by
wearing a long sleeve Tokyo Rising Moon Hash T-Shirts. I saw him running
on the Kyoto HHH on Thursday night. He was overdressed then as well. Yakitori's
Husband almost a virgin Moon hasher had a lot of difficulties to find out
the way (arrows) at the check point. So he claims, but the &quot;Moon Madness&quot;
virus has perhaps infected his soul! The course was a bit confusing because
many of the marks (arrows and flour) looked very much like road re-construction
in the aftermath of the big earthquake. Yakitori-san constantly gave strongly
worded instruction and advice to her husband in order to prevent him from
running astray. One can only concluded, she wears the &quot;Moon Pants
in the family&quot; He should be so lucky! Happiness is hashing together.
</P>
<P>
I, CM, was very surprised when during this hash in Mikage we ran right
in front of the house under construction ........ this is same house where
I am employee of&quot;Hash Crash&quot; to build the house. Yes, it is where
I actual work. During this run, we saw Lug Nuts, who can really move race
walking, doing the course backwards! Did he watch our &quot;Mooning the
Moon&quot; at temporary school under the goal posts? Score!!!!!!
</P>
<P>
The &quot;ON-ON&quot; was held at GFL's place. At his house, Semen explained
to me about his furniture that all the furniture including a nice TV. &amp;
Audio system set was founded and picked up off the road by PETER. I think
that &quot;Home Party&quot; is a good chance for someone to brag about
their cooking. Peter's Famous Spaghetti Sauce is very healthy and made
completely from vegetables. He didn't use meat or shell for the sauce.
Wanda made a pumpkin Croquette. On that day, Hash Pig(Åâ) came to the run
alone. He could eat some nice food at the ON-ON, although he didn't have
lunch, because of Mrs.Pig's was working. ON-ON!

Since love/lust has been in the air on the most recent
KFMH3 On-On, this run, our Valentine Run, was described a as run that had
something for everyone. For those like Wanda and Dr. Dog-Style for those
who found love on the Hash! (Then, Wanda did not show up due to a wedding)
For Triathon Bob and Snake Semen it was a run for those who are looking
for love in all the wrong places! Or for Slimie Limie it was a run advertised
as a run for those looking for adventure on the Hash! Lastly, it was dubbed
as a run for GFL and CM, as a run for those looking for love/lust on the
KFMH3 ........
</P>
<P>
About nine or ten tough KFM hashers were called into action on this
bleak, snowy day. Did that worry CM? Not a chance. He promptly went into
action and put together some paper hearts that were pasted to every hashers
hind quarters. There were some newcomers to the Kinky Full Moon Hash on
this run such as Slimie Limie who true to form and he decided to wear some
very bright pants &amp; a short T-shirt! Very Kinky! Also, there was Occupational
Hazard (Yuki) and Tokyo Ladies Hasher called &quot;Coming In Public&quot;
who decided to join the hash twice while in the Kansai. Out a sense of
hospitality we decided not ask her how she got saddled with that name.
</P>
<P>
Despite a mild protest form some nameless observer, we waited for Dr
Dog-style, Fumie and Triathon Bob who arrived about 30 minutes late. The
pack started off somewhat together wound it way though the very step terrain.
It a beautiful course set by Lolita and her boyfriend, Imamura-kun. Every
so often the front runners Occupational Hazard and Slimey Limey kindly
waited for those who were not so ambitious. Nevertheless everyone arrived
at some famous waterfall. We came, talked some and Mooned the Moon! The
tourist from the countryside were either amazed or horrified by the KFM
hashers. We discovered a couple of monkeys who were willing to brave the
cold, yet seem to have more sense than the this collection of hashers.
</P>
<P>
From that point the sun came out and warmed our spirits and bodies.
The course was varied from very steep to extremely steep which challenged
our hearts and quite long-perhaps 12 or 13Km. If there was any need to
justify our actions on this cold day, the breathtaking scenery made it
worthwhile. Some staggered to the goal about three hours later. And some
even took a short cut on the last part of the course and made it home.
And even three Hashers were lost from the rest of us! Many of us wondered
out loud where could they be. The mood was one of a sense of urgency and
concern. These hapless Hashers-Triathon Bob, CM and Coming In Public were
quite lucky that CM had some money and they caught a bus to Mino Station.
Many thanks for Imamura-kun and Gobshite who went back to look for these
hasher. Also many thanks to Lolita and her boyfriend (he needs a Hash name!)
for taking us through a challenging, but very beautiful course!
</P>
<P>
The On-On was at "OSHO", or the local Chinese greasy spoon&quot;,
and lasted several hours until 9:30. However, it was a great time with
the Hashers having some good conversation, food, and beer. &quot;Unfortunately&quot;
(depending on your point of view!) there were no Downs-Downs and no Swing
Low....but remember there are rules on the Hash!!!!!

on the HASH, your soul goes up on a mountain and gets stuck there.

</P>
<P>
February 22, Seventeen people, who were divided into 4 cars,
arrived at Sukebe's log cabin just past noon. It is located near the Tottori-Hyogyo
border. I left with Snake Semen from Takarazuka at around 7:00am to avoid
the heavy traffic and Snake Semen had a car navigation system in his car.
This navigation system is all Semen can or will trust. He never dared to
believe Ulysses's wisdom nor his expertise of the highway system. You may
wonder how did this navigation system perform? Did it meet our expectations?
This instrument told us to go through Bantan-toll-road which was extremely
crowded!!!!!! Welcome to the technology age! On-On!!!!!
</P>
<P>
After arriving &quot;Sukebe-So&quot;, some people removed a lot of snow
and the other people cooked pilaff &amp; spaghetti for lunch. They did
great job........But, it's not easy to satisfy the appetite of 17 hungry
Hashers. After having lunch, some went out for skiing, and the other stayed
at cabin........ Most notable was Triathon Bob watching sports videos such
as the Super Bowl. Sukebe who decided to go to cooking school from next
May, and Mickey Mouse cooked spareribs with some vegetables. And of course,
there was plenty of beer for everyone except Shinji, Snake Semen's son.
Sukebe had BBQ going outside and food seem to never end......hamburgers,
grilled chicken, potatoes, mushrooms, shrimps, stew with spareribs, beef
stew, fresh salad, spareribs cooked with coca-cola. After all our stomachs
were full. The supper was better than anyone imagined! The cooking school!
DOWN-DOWNS were given to everyone, even to Shinji(Semen son,) got two.
Then CM went back to work in the kitchen and cooked a lot of pork &amp;
oyster GYOZA.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the weather was warm and sunny and I found that Beerhead
came in during the night. He drove all the way during after his KABUKI
performance, drank some and fell asleep in a chair. In the morning, we
skied together, abused each other while Triathon Bob read his SI magazine
while waiting to get on the ski lift! Some things never change! Thank you
Sukebe-san for the wonderful ski-weekend trip! ON-ON!!

Why didn't you come to this Wonderful Run?
</P>
<P>
Since love was in the air of Mino, CM decided to take us to hills of
Ishikiri that overlooked the Nara/Ikoma area. It was dubbed as a run for
those looking for adventure on the Hash! As Lugnuts told CM &amp; GFL &quot;he
would come&quot; on Saturday......and BT who was over heard uttering: &quot;That's
news to me&quot;!
</P>
<P>
Apparently, they both &quot;failed to come&quot;.....some lame excuse
was used as &quot;I have to go to a JALT Meeting I forgot about&quot;!
Snake Semen did not come because he claimed that he couldn't read the fine
print anymore due to his advanced age! Dr. Dog-Style seems to be overtaken
by a rare case puppy love in Kyushu, thus he has been left permanently
weakened.
</P>
<P>
Anyway we took off to the start via a cable car that took us to the
top of the mountain. GFL &amp; Triathon Bob did most of the talking that
seem to revolve around sports: Are the 49ers days numbered? The University
of Minnesota basketball team chances seem good.... The Lakers lost again.....High
Five!!!!
</P>
<P>
We slowly weaved our way down the mountain past a some very old temples
and shrines. This run was far from the madness of the city and we probably
only ran into four or five people on the trail. The view was breathtaking.
About an hour later, we entered the urban area again, and we staggered
to the goal dodging the traffic and then proceeded to hand out down-downs
in the sunshine.
</P>
<P>
Also many thanks to CM, despite having a painful broken finger, for
taking us through the most beautiful course I have had the opportunity
to run. Let's do it again in the summer! A Great Run! A Great Day!! ON-ON!!

A pronounced absence of a scribe here, but I was there, as were LugNuts
and Wanda, it was very, very wet, and we took a (free) ferry across the
harbour to finish the run at JR Sakurajima, one of the least blossomy places
I know. So there you are.
