Since I was out of touch for a while travelling around the world and
missing the historic #1000 Run and the Inter Hash Festival Since September,
I thought I would show up at a couple of Kinky Fully
Moon runs.......Then, I ended as MOON MASTER! Such is fate. So, I felt
I should scribe this first Hash of the new administration.
</P>
<P>
Oh, what a day! Oh what a run! To be honest the run seems to be a kind
of blur. If this report appears to rather off, please have a forbearing
heart and spirit because the heat &amp; humidity put my brain into a major
shutdown ....
</P>
<P>
With the promise of a shorter run than the record setter in the Ashiya
Hills, an eager but a small of Kinky Full-Moon hashers departed from Himeji
Station. Dr Dog-style put the mood in motion by screaming and yelling On-On
that stunned most of the locals. The Hash worked its way around the castle
grounds up some burial grounds that was unknown to any hasher before this
fateful day. Some of the Japanese members wanted to discuss the religious
significance of the moment. It seemed heat took its toll with a fews hashers
hallucinating and one claiming to having a spiritual experience and some
unnamed hasher sai d he had seen the Almighty!!! But it did not end there,
some of the Japanese members wanted to discuss the religious significance
of the moment. However, a long time Hasher, Lug Nuts, pushed the discussion
to a horrified silence by bragging about some his &quot;high school experiences&quot;!
Where is Mother Theresa when we need her? 
</P>
<P>
The highlights of the run seem to be the water &amp; beer check at Yokozuna's
homestay family. They way they talked about our &quot;Yokozuna&quot; it
seemed that he really has not moved out. &quot;once our boy, always our
boy&quot;!!!!!!!!!! Business cards were passed out (this deserved a Down-Down)
and we went on our way to the finish. A few Downs-Downs were given out
to Mrs Pig and Kahori for not &quot;Mooning the Moon&quot;, then we and
we were On-In........
</P>
<P>
The ON-ON was a small but tumultuous affair and our behavior was generally
loud and disorderly true to hash tradition. The New Moon Master, yours
truly, got Down-Down for being saddled with the position and got another
saying &quot;What BONENKAI T-shirt&quot;.....I always refer to that shirt
as &quot;the blue Hash T-shirt&quot;. Chinko got a smaller down-down for
being selected as my other half. A virgin hasher named Kahori, was given
her hash name, &quot;Victorian Rash&quot;. It has been rumored, she is
now checking out Victoria Secret Catlogs. Any volunteers as her fashion
consultant? Wanda where are you?
</P>
<P>
However, during our rendition of Swing-Low on the platform, Dr Dog-Style
who is at times zealous and too enthusiastic, jammed his head on the rim
with some &quot;hang time&quot; to spare on while we sang I looked over
Jordan! The train ride back was rowdy as the Kinky Full Moon has seen and
most of JR's customers stayed well clear of the noise. Yokozuna still in
form as hare, and sent Lug Nuts searching for a toilet only to find there
was a CB. The good new goods was he eventually found a place to relieve
himself.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, Dr Dog-Style' friend from France has been given a tentative
Hash name, &quot;Barf Blanc&quot; for his any eruptions on the way back!
The last I heard all were well on Monday.... ON-ON!

新しいOfficerによる姫路ランは、、、ゴールデンウィークのランより短いという
約束で、ハッシャーは姫路駅をスタート。姫路城で誰も知らなかったお墓を 発見して、宗教的な話題が白熱したり、
横綱がホームスティしていた家でのビアチェックがあったり、と楽しいラン。
ランのあとはmooningをしなかったKaori &amp; Mr.PigがDown-Down. そしてON-ONへ。ON-ONでも新しいマスターやCo-MasterにDown-Downがあったり
いつものことながら賑やかなON-ONでした。最後に駅でスイングローを歌っている時に
、 Dr.Dog Styleは飛び上がった時に駅の案内表示板に頭をぶつけました。

１０月１３日 日曜日、前日の雨がうそのようなとってもよいお天気。ヘアは怪我
（骨折）を したキャロルに代わって凸凹とRoxxxoff(John Kenny). 場所は、神戸市
北区にある“しあわ せの村”。ランナーはトライアスロンボブ、ゴブシャイテ、
ワンダ、遅れてきたピーターに Hash Pig x 2でした。ちょっと淋しいかなぁと思って
いたけれど、これだけ集まればＧｏｏ ｄ！とワンダは 満足そうでした。スコットランド祭が行われ、バグパイプの音楽が鳴り響く
中、 スタート。一番、最初のチェックでどれもＣＢ。 やっぱり温泉に入って帰るか？
と思っ ていたところ、アローを発見。 そのあと、すぐ丘の上でMoon the Moon!!
</P>
<P>
汗でパンティが張り付いてあがらない、、、と焦るワンダがセクシーでした。明石
海峡大橋 や淡路島を眺めたり、めっちゃかわいい鳥の形の木を発見したりしながら
、広大なしあわせ の村の敷地内をとっても楽しく走りました。 トライアスロンボブも
&quot;Good Picture&quot;と大喜び でした。 Down-Downはヘアに始まって、適当な理由を
つけられて、メンバー全員が Down-Down。 ワンダはワンダフルデーだからという
理由でDown-Down。最後に、ニュー シューズが発覚した凸凹(*hinko *anko)は
シューズにてんこ盛りにされたビアで Down-Down そのあとは、それぞれ、温泉に
入ったり、木陰や日当？でお昼寝をしたりとて も気持ちのよいハッピーなランでした。

Despite the heavy rains on the previous Saturday, on Sunday October
13, the weather was fine. Chinko Manko &amp; Roxxxoff set the trail instead
of Carol who was stuck in a hospital after breaking a bone in her elbow.
The run took place in Shiawase-no-mura and the following hashers showed
up: Triathon Bob, Gobshite, Wanda, Peter who came slightly late, and the
Hash Pig x 2. I felt a bit lonely, but Wanda looked happy that at six hashers
came to this remote park to take part in the Full Moon Hash.
</P>
<P>
While the Scottish Highland Games and Festival were taking place and
sound of bagpipe music in our ears, we started. The first check cause a
lot of confusion, that slowed down our progress. All directions seem to
result in a &quot;CB&quot;! Soon I was thinking I should gone to the public
bath instead of run in these hills.
</P>
<P>
At last, we were on the course and we soon Mooned-the-Moon at the top
of a small hill. Wanda was hot, sweating, and sexy. This caused some difficulties
when she tried to pull up her pants. The run was very pleasant that took
us through the village and the runners were able to enjoy the view of the
Akashi Channel Bridge and Awajishima. Also, Bob proclaimed what a great
view.
</P>
<P>
After, the run was completed everyone was given a Down-Down: The hare
&amp; co-hare, Peter (shortcut), Goshite (many reasons), Mr Pig (for asking
Mrs Pig to get married), Mrs Pig (for accepting), etc., etc., etc. After
checking the Scottish Highland Games and Festival some went to the public
bath and some &quot;passed out&quot; under the trees. I guess the weather,
the view as well as the park was just too wonderful! On-On!

スタートの時間の直前に汗をいっぱいかいたRoxxxoffが現れた。ロックガーデンのランは
ど んなものか予想していたが、息をきらした彼を見るとそれ以上に大変らしかった。
ハッシュ ホーンがなかったのと、ピーターがつれてきた２人のニューカマーがいたので、
みんなでま とまって走ることにした。マラソン好きのもう一人のニューカマーのデイーンは
フラワーを 探してくれ、ワンダは後ろからみんなをケアしてくれた。 ロックガーデンでは野生の猪(?!
Roxxxoffの奥さんと子供）が出迎えてくれ、たくさんの 登山者から「こんにちわ」と言われ
た。マーキングは分かりやすかったが、ところどころ 左側にマークしてあり、すかさずダウ
ンダウンの口実になった。景色がきれいなので ゆっくり鑑賞したかったが、日没の時間が心
配であきらめざるを得なかった。 ムーンポイントではワンダが例によってレクチャーをして
くれた。 なんとか日没前に芦屋川に着いてほっとした。 オンオンはちょっといつもと違っ
た。誰もビールを頼まずとってもヘルシーだった。

Just before the start time ,a very very sweaty Roxxxoff appeared. Every
hasher already knew how the sight of the Rock Garden was and had a kind
of preparation in their minds, however breathless Roxxxoff made the pack
think the run was tougher than they expected. Gobshite decided to take
gloves with him and Wanda had her globes of course . On the day we had
two female new comers, Get fuckin' lost had dragged along, and what was
worse, no hash horn !! The pack kept running together as the Hare advised,
and some were given roles. Another new comer Dean, a marathon runner, found
flour and led the others to the right direction , Wanda took care for the
pack from the back.
</P>
<P>
Climbing up to the Rock Garden, Wild boars ,15 or more, welcomed us,
some of hikers, who passed by, encouraged us by saying &quot;hello&quot;,
but most of them maybe thought us as a weird group. Despite various way
,climbing ,hiking (or walking ) and running a little, we had no difficulty
to find the way. Some were on the left, I was sure that our experienced
Hare did so on purpose for another Down-Down. The trail went by some vista,
the pack wanted to stop to admire the landscape with autumn leaves, but
the coming sunset urged them to keep running.
</P>
<P>
At the Moon Check Wanda, a Moon lecturer, gave the demonstration of
advanced mooning. The pack in a line and Wanda did the ceremony at the
top of the rock where some rock climbers were at 3 meters' distance. Out
of the rocked place some started dash to home. They wanted to run? No!
They wanted not to stay there in the darkness. Before the real moon coming
the pack came back. &quot;Relieved&quot; ☆☆ Some were given Down-Down;
the hare,new comers and Roxxxoff again for left marking. The On-On were
small, but unusual. Nobody ordered beer ! We enjoyed typical Rock-ko hiking
hash and unusual healthy On-On.

10月27日、日曜日、大阪港で海を眺めながらのランは、秋らしい天候も加わって
とても気持 ちが良い。休日のデートを楽しむカップル達の合間を通り抜けてラン。
暫く走ると。目印 （アロー &amp; フラワー）がなくなってしまって、みんな半信半疑で
走ってたのだけど、結局、 道が見つからなくて、Give-Up! Roxxxoffが代わりに
Hare(live-hare)になって、再びラ ン。 大幅なショートカットであっという間のランでしたので、公園で帰りを待っている
Lug Nutsをみんなで走っていって脅かしました。
</P>
<P>
それから、港まで行って大勢の観客(?)のいる中で、&quot;Moon the Moon&quot;!
Down-Downでは、 分かりにくいコースをセットしたLug Nuts、初ハッシュ(New
Comer)のSuzanne、淡路のマ ラソンに出たGet Fuckin Lost(Peter)、ムーンチェックを
ちゃんとしなかったSweat PeecockとVictorian Rash、ニューシューズが発覚した
Victorian Rashはもう一度、 Down-Down!! Wandaが、&quot;Mooning&quot;が出来ない２人に特別実演してくれたり、再びムーンチ
ェックを して、記念撮影をしたり、ON-ONに行く途中で、港の高台に登って沈む夕日を眺め
たり と、楽しいハッシュでした。

Since it was a beautiful autumn day we were in a good mood to go running
around the scenic course at the Osaka-port. Lug Nuts set the course and
the beginning had hopes of a good Hash experience. To here was Wanda, Roxxxoff,
Sweat Peacock, Gobshite &amp; Victorian Rash, and Suzanne, a newcomer.
</P>
<P>
Our Horn, Dr Dog-Style as usual led our small but enthusiastic band
of Hasher. At his side a very fit new newcomer, Suzanne, followed by Wanda,
Roxxxoff who just happened to run a 10 Km in the morning, CM, GFL, Sweat
Peacock, Gobshite &amp; Victorian Rash. We ran past a number of couples
who were enjoying a lazy day in the park, and continued on weaving in the
park for 20 minutes or so.
</P>
<P>
Then our small pack of hashers came to a abrupt halt. No marks whatsoever!
Was this a sign of things to come.........rumors began........the insults
started fly. We ran for what seemed forever (1.5Km to 2Km) without flour
or arrows and began to doubt if a course was even set. Then Lug Nuts name
became universally accepted as an object for unlimited HASH ABUSE!!!!!!
</P>
<P>
After much &quot;trash-talking&quot;of the hare, the run was abandoned,
and then the Moon master appointed Roxxxoff as a live-hare who brought
us back home. To surprise Lug Nuts who was waiting for us a our&quot; Home&quot;
(park). As Predicted, Lug Nuts defended himself by stating: &quot;you-should-never-
trusted-me-you-blew-it!!!!!!!&quot;
</P>
<P>
It was pointed out by Gobshite that in the course of running this ill
fated Hash, we completely missed the MOON CHECK!!! Thank God for his astute
sense of tradition and legal procedure on the Hash. So, we stumble off
to the port near Kaiyu-kan (big famous aquarium), and &quot;Mooned the
Moon&quot; and caused a stir among large audience.
</P>
<P>
Then down-down were given to Lug Nuts(hare), to Suzanne (new-comer),
to GFL (Awajishima Half Marathon), to Sweat Peacock &amp; Victorian Rash(for
refusing to Moon the Moon), Another down-down for Victorian Rash(for new
shoes).
</P>
<P>
After a more few down-downs, Wanda demonstrated how to &quot;Moon the
Moon&quot; to Sweat Peacock &amp; Victorian Rash who were impressed. Then,
on their third attempt they finally succeed. In order to caputure this
Magic Moment of KFM Hash History, (yea, right!) Gobshite took a photo.......this
deserves a Down-Down!
</P>
<P>
On the way to the &quot;ON-ON&quot;, all enjoyed setting sun at the
port. Despite the problems, It was a good afternoon with great weather!
