</P>
<P>
We were welcomed by Miso-Horny at the station and walked up to Yokozuna-Beya
which stood at the head of a steep slope.  The ascent was giddily steep,
wasn't it? If Yokozuna realises something at home on my way to the station,
he will probably not return, I suppose. We checked out Yokozuna-Beya and
our run started after three o'clock. The downward slope was awful as well.
Semen had to carry on his shoulder the bicycle of Shinji-kun, junior Semen.
What a great father! All too soon, we were passing through a path in the
woods and found our way to a shrine. There was a monument of Kobo-daishi
of "Kobo-mo-fude-no-ayamari. (Even Homer sometimes nods.)" It
seemed that an old-fashioned wedding was going on. Some Obasans in Tomesode
and mellow Ojisans were there. Oh, yes, Flash sprained his ankle when he
stuck his leg in hole in the bush and groaned in pain suddenly while he
was running in the woods. If you find any obstacles, please do warn the
followers. Anyway, Semen was worried about the log! As is usual with us,
we had a Moon-Check at the head of the stairs of the shrine and Peter checked
all the girls' asses. We ran down on the gentle slope to Hankyu Kawanishi
-Noseguchi Station. We sang a "Happy Birthday Fuck You" song
to Yokozuna, Miso-Horny and Nick with lots of love.
</P>
<P>
On-On was at a Kushi-katsu restaurant. We looked at photos taken at
Sukebe-So. Very enjoyable Sunday, wasn't it? Incidentally, Yokozuna-Beya's
opening memorial T-shirt was sold at 1,700 yen. Has everyone got it? Flash
tried to sell it at 1,000 yen to the people passing by, but, unfortunately,
no good at all.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, Yokozuna-Beya opening memorial run and party is planned in November.
Lovely maples with red leaves will be to here. Look forward to seeing you
all there. ON-ON

<P>
This run was the first attempt for Kinky Fully Mooned HHH to have a
Joint Run followed by Bar-B-Que with Kobe HH Harriettes. I decided to head
up to the meeting place, Hanshin Ishiyagawa-St. from Nishinomiya by running.
But, it was too hot to run. I took many breaks on my way to the meeting
place. When I had almost no idea where I run, finally I got to the meeting
place somehow. Meanwhile, we could see Bite Size &amp; Shyakuhachi, and
Bonsai coming. I was very surprised because I hadn't seen Bonsai at Kinky's
Run for about 1 year! But, it was a &quot;Happy-Surprise&quot;! Bi-Sexial
also came bringing some beautiful ladies from Ladies HHH with him. He was
doubly blessed! I can understand why he prefers Ladies Hash so much and
he never comes to Men's Hash. It was already past 3:00pm when we were supposed
to start, but we decided to wait for a few more minutes expecting some
other people would turn up. Ladies Members decided to make earlier start
ahead of us, because they were slow joggers. After 5 minutes from their
start, we started to run. The sun shined mercilessly. It didn't take a
long time before we drunk up the mineral-water which was supplied by Hare.
Only Slimie Limie could overcome such heat and run without difficulties.
WHY? We need more Beer? (Always! - I was LOOKING for beer! SL) We had a
short rest to enjoy some drinks (what we call Beer-Check) (except there
wasn't any beer... Down-Down for the hare! SL) at the shrine on our way
to the Mooning Place. Moon Check Point was set between two golf practice
grounds where GFL loves. After that, Get Fuckin' Lost led us on a short
cut. Of course, we passed out in front of his apartment house before we
arrived &quot;On-Home&quot;. Beer was so delicious! (I didn't see any...
SL)
</P>
<P>
Soon after we started the BBQ, some non-runner (Erection, Flash and Hand-Job)
showed up. Of course, they got a Down-Down for non-runner! At the BBQ,
there were not only meat &amp; vegetables but also Japanese fine noodle (vermicelli)
and some kinds of fruits were supplied. They left nothing to be desired!
We attempted to break a watermelon. It was Flash who could break it completely.
After Swing-Low, some people went to Public Bath and then had another spree
(2-jikai) at Flash's place. We were all happy!

At Takanohara station Dr. Dog Style, a very pregnant Fumie and Sweet
Peacock who had been sick, took our bags and the hounds took to the trail.
It was hot. After circling the station a few times we broke away to see
the vistas of Nara. Looking at the multiple train lines stretching away,
the houses covering the nearby hills and the few cars on the expansive
roads, Lolita said it perfectly &quot;Waaa, Inaka Da !&quot;. Yes truly
we felt one with nature in this urban wilderness. It was quite hot by now.
On we wandered. Frequently accusing each other of shortcutting when in
fact the course had numerous possible interpretations. Quite similar to
our hare in fact. It was hot. Following the arrows we found ourselves in
D.D.S's apartment with cool drinks all round. Wanda &amp; Slimie Limie
promptly went to sleep on the floor. Let me mention at this stage that
it was a hot day. Kicking us out we were advised &quot;You're not half-way
yet!&quot;. More quiet streets, we bunned the sun without scandal. Returning
to the station and blessed rehydration as it had been somewhat hot. At
the OnOn a video camera was passed around to get pictures for the new hash
homepage. Dr.Dog Style was happily engaged in toungewhip kissing with Fumie.
This led to a naming ceremony whereby she became known as &quot;Does It
With Dogs&quot;. By now they have returned to England and I can safely
write whatever I want about them. Seriously though, they go with all our
wishes for a bright future. It was the general consensus that they are
quite a hot couple.

The weather was beautiful, sunny, 95 deg. F (35C). The run started off
as a hot one. We started dogging under and through the JR tracks until
we hit the first check. We split up and soon heard HJ yelling &quot;On-On&quot;.
Low and behold, it was a CB. She had never been and FRB and yelled &quot;On-On&quot;
after the first arrow &quot;DOWN-DOWN&quot;. Ryoko-chan got us back on
trail. The trail meandered until we hit the river. God only knows what
was in the river, but it smelled like shit. The next check took us over
the river, back to the JR tracks. There was a Moon Check in which an exuberant
Wanda mooned the Kaisoku to Kyoto. The trailed followed South to the Hankyu
line (Hankyu is South in that part of Kansai) to a park. There we met an
imposing fencing. HJ scarred her leg as this was her first time over a
fence in her life. Ryoko, a gymnast, had no problem. Next stop was a quaint
little housing area. Nothing exciting. the trail did cross a street in
which everyone shortcutted except CM and were rewarded with DOWN-DOWN's
at the end. It was getting hot and people tired. After heading through
a wooded area, the pack broke up. Wanda, CM, and Flash headed on, while
the others walked back. We arrived back at the start where stale beer awaited
us. Twenty minutes later, the walkers caught up.</P>
<P>Everyone rested up, drank some fluids and changed. Flash got a sneak
peek at Ryoko as he decided to change behind this building which she was
undressing behind. (Pinkish-brown if I remember correctly.) DOWN-DOWN's
were tough. Everyone received a few. Ryoko-chan collapsed in the circle
as she was probably dehydrated. She was out until the 6AM the night before.
She was revived and drank lots of water. CM was trying to get her to take
off her shirt to cool her down. DOWN-DOWN?
</P>
<P>
The On-In was in Juso at Ulysses' place. We had some food bought on
the street and waited for the Juso Hanabi Taikai. Ulysses showed us naked
pictures of his model girlfriend. She is hot. We drank, at least I did,
Tibetan alcohol (50%). That shit was strong. At 8PM, we headed to the Yodogawa
River and watched colored fireworks for 1 hour. Some foreigners could not
deal with the crowds, but the Japanese enjoyed themselves. Overall a good
run and fireworks party. Hope nobody tried to find the On-In in Takatuki.
