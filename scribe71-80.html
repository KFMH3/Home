When I arrived at Tenma Station, I couldn't find any arrows. So, decided
to walk around the Station. While I was looking for arrows or instructions
for the starting point, I found the arrows which was one of the trail to
back to the Station. So, I went back to the station and waited for others.
But, nobody turned up for a while. So, I was getting a bit nervous and
worried. But, NEWT, Hash Pig &amp; Pig Porker, *hinko *anko, and Enka-Bird
from Ladies Hash came. Soon after Bunter-Bon came to join. After 5 minutes
or so, the hare and co-hare came back and we were told that we should leave
our bags in coin-lockers.
</P>
<P>
We run through the shopping streets and came to Umeda &amp; Ogimachi.
and run round and round around that area before going to the pedestrian
bridge where was today's mooning place. After mooning, we run down to Nakanoshima,
then went to the place called OAP(?? or something like that). That place
was the area newly developed and advertised a lot in magazines and the
city-paper. For me, it was the first time to visit there. After that, we
continued to run for a while, about 10 minutes to the &quot;HOME&quot;.
What I felt interesting and amazing at the run was that all runners held
together from the beginning to the end.
</P>
<P>
When we back to the &quot;Home&quot;, we found Flash who had just returned
from his business trip. He was changing into his running gear. At the same
time I heard that Slimie had lost our coin locker's key while running.
So, Slimie Limie decided to run once more, and I decided to wait for them
at the station. Kindly, Pig-Porker helped to look for the key on a bicycle
which he borrowed from Roxxoff. Others went to the Sento (=Public Bath)
ahead of us. While I was waiting, Lug Nuts, who had been late for the meeting
time and made a late start, arrived back. And BH, who had wanted to join
all Hashes in the Kansai area within 1 week showed up. Despite searching
we couldn't find the key, so asked the service-man to open the locker.</P>
<P>On-On was at Sweet PeaCock and Roxxoff's new apartment. The food was
great, pizza, French bread, Sweet PeaCock's special salad and RoxxxOff's
home-made beef stew. HJ came for the ON-ON all the way from Hanaten by
bicycle with some delicious Chirashi-Sushi she'd made. Then Can't Blow
(now re-named 'Goes Down Well'. Ask her to explain it.) showed up with
an IOC friend and MORE BEER! Wonderful! Well fed and watered hashers then
departed back to their homes.

This run was for Mother Theresa who is thinking of leaving here sometime
in the spring and agreed to bless our hash! Apparently, the divine one
and her saintly cohort, Phuckwit, were out and about trying to save souls
until the crack of dawn. They set about their mission and set a rather
good course.
</P>
<P>
Since I just return from a month long holiday in New Zealand, I was
greeted by the die hard hashers and I was freezing. Mother Theresa proclaimed
the course was &quot;flat&quot; to our astonishment it was anything but
flat. Triathon Bob and Slimie Limie were out in front were lured into a
steep valley with a CB waiting. Then on the way back, Can't Blow showed
up after her party from the night before! Rumor has it, that she fell face
first on to her bedding at a very late hour. Doesn't anyone on the hash
except Triathon Bob go to bed on Saturday night?</P>
<P>The trail lead us straight up a steep hill to the remote areas of Nigawa,
then through a series of water checks where Wanda swam to the front of
the pack. After that we wiggled our way on the train tracks to on home.
As expected, Ulysses kept us waiting and the circle was brief. Some of
those received downs-downs were GFL for bungy jumping (with photos to prove
it!), CM for keeping Ulysses company on the run, and Bunter for not running..................
</P>
<P>
Finally, Slimie Limie paid for his sins with a down-down for not swimming
and in Wanda's words, "for already eating a FISH"!
</P>
<P>
I would not be doing my job if I did not mention, that Can't Blow finally
has learn to blow the horn. Has she been taking lessons? On-On!

<P>
There's me turning up at Mikage Station on the best day this year - mini
skirt weather - even the station guard was playing pocket billiards on
this English summer like day - and I expected a riotous throng of hashers
to greet me.  But NO!  All I find is Mariko on the platforn looking for the
bog, and down below, GFL, Slimie Limie, Wanda and new boot Ayako.
Pathetic eh?  Everyone else was either out skipping across some bridge or
making daisy chains in the garden.
</P>
<P>
After being accosted by a crazed woman asking if we were baseball players,
GFL led us to his place, from whence the run began.  Poor Ayako couldn't
get to grips with the idea that it's ok to hang around at a check and let
everyone else do the work.
</P>
<P>
We wended our way through the back streets of GFL's neighbourhood and at
one part found ourselves up a dead end alley marked with a strange flour X.
 This was guarded by a MAD DOG who slobbered and slavered at the sight of
Slimie Limie's legs.  It howled in distress though when its obasan owner
got there first.
</P>
<P>
Onward we pounded and nearly lost Wanda on a check as she came across a
later part of the trail she wasn't supposed to see.  Then it was decision
time.  The Rambo course for the men and the Girlie course for the girlies.
</P>
<P>
Slimie and my good self fancying ourselves as rugged he-man types opted
for the Rambo course which took us straight up one side of a river and
straight back down the other.  Nice bit of stonework though.
Back at the bottom we rejoined the girlies and bared our bottoms for all
to see.  GFL had torn himself away from his spaghetti and was there handing
out beers - good man.
</P>
<P>
After this we ran up and down a few more roads and lo and behold, back we
were at the start.  Victuals awaited us in GFL's place cooked by his own
fair hands.  Later, Triathalon Bob, Bonsai and CU turned up pretending to
be tired after running across a bridge - we must have crossed at least 5
but not one comlaint was to be heard from us.  We ate heartily, drank
deeply, sang lustily and went home to fart roundly.

</P>
<P>
Originally, it was to be a wedding run followed by a bath at a
'Sento' and a Big Party at the 'Pig & Whistle'.  We planned
to reserve the whole place to celebrate Roxxxoff & Sweat Peecock's
Wedding.
 However, we had to cancel the reservation at the Pig &
Whistle and change this plan because of too many weddings and too
many hashesin the Kansai Area.  Another couple had their wedding on
the same day and Kyoto H3 decided to have another run.  Why did
these matters for congratulation all happen on the same day?  So
instead of the party at the P & W, it was decided to have a picnic
under the beautiful Sakura.
</P>
<P>
It was about 0:20pm (sorry we were late) when I arrived at the
Sento where we should meet and start. But, nobody was there.
Even the hares(Roxxoff and Peecock) weren't there.
I wondered if others went off already. Anyway, we left our baggage
in the sento. When we were about to run, we saw the hares coming
by bicycle. "Where are others??" we asked. "I don't know.
we just came here now. Anyway, I think you will need 1 hour
to go to the wedding place, the Rose Garden. So, see you in 1 hour!"
Roxxxoff replied. Then, we began to run. Oh, I forgot to explain
about the weather. It was a very nice summer day.
</P>
<P>
We ran through the Hotels Area and came to the first 'Check Point'.
We couldn't see any trace for that check, it seemed that nobody
was running before us!  So, we had to find the true trail.
It wasn't so difficult. After running for a while, we
came to OBP (Osaka Business Park, Kyobashi). The flour led us into
TWIN21 building(s) which are my company's buildings. But, that
was not the true trail. We found true trail outside of the building,
and then headed to Osaka-Castle. After Osaka-Castle, we came to the
3rd Check Point and saw the trace someone had checked already. Maybe
somebody must be running before us! The trail led us to an extremely
crowded area along the river with a lot of Sakura where it looked difficult
to run.  So, we decided to run along another street until Nakanoshima
(Rose-Garden).  It wasn't a short-cut because the
streets we took were completely parallel to the true trail!
</P>
<P>
At the Rose Garden, we saw 'Wait Here" written on the small
bridge. It was exactly 1:30pm. But nobody was there again.
Where were the front hashers??  Maybe we've got ahead of them,
as we didn't follow the true trail?? Anyway, we were waiting.
About 10 minutes later, nobody came except the hares.
So, we decided to go back to the Sento and to have a picnic.
</P>
<P>
When we went into the Sento, we saw Ms. Wet T-shirt who
just came out from the bath. We heard that she and some
others ran but couldn't find arrows, so she came back
and others were still running.
</P>
<P>
After having the bath, we saw CM, Lolita, Triathlon Bob, GFL,
Bunter-Bon, Miso Horny and Beerhead. After talking with CM,
Lolita and Bunter-Bon, I discovered the truth - all people were
late for the meeting time, and everybody turned up at a slightly different
time between 0:15pm and 0:25pm.  And of course, they all (including me)
ran.  But, some of them couldn't find arrows well
and quit.  It took time to come back.  Some of them were at the
Rose Garden just before us (so around 1:25pm).  Pity!
</P>
<P>
Beerhead - his shoulder bone was re-located, and Erection
who didn't run came to join the picnic. At the beginning of
the picnic, Slimie Limie carried out the hash wedding.
</P>
<P>
Roxxxoff & Sweat Peecock, Congratulations!
<BR>
and thanks for all work you did for this run.

I wonder where yesterday's lovely weather had gone, we had typical
English weather, courtesy of our English Hare, Newt. SL, Wanda, GFL,
Penasonic,
Flash, Humping Iron and two guys were there when I arrived at the
station. One was a Hasher from London called Hairy Fairy, and the other
guy named Tamotsu was one of my college mates in London who hardly
spoke to English people since he came back.
</P>
<P>
There were quite many checks on the trail today and we were running
together. After Mooning at a Yodo river bank, the allows showed us to
run on the embankment like a balance beam. However, two acrophobes,
SL and me, gave up. Then, there was a huge dumping ground in a park.
Although
everyone looked at old-fashined FAX machine, TV threatened
with fire and so on carefully, rubbish is rubbish after all,
nobody took anything. It was not true, we saw Flash carrying
something in his hand. He acquired a trophy of bowling
inscribed Section Competition (Showa) 46.12.25 (Christmas, 1971 for the
gaijins
out there).  If it said, it would be your exact birthday, Flash!
It was a great pity!
</P>
<P>
Flash got lost at the last check and Wanda & SL went to find him.
Finally, he came back empty-handed. "Where is your trophy?" asked Wanda.
"What
are you talking about?" Flash replied pretending
ignorance. Wanda testified that Flash had thrown it away
just before the Home to avoid DOWN-DOWN. However, Wanda went to
take it back and Flash got RUBBISH DOWN-DOWN!
</P>
<P>
We had ON-IN at a tiny Chinese restaurant in front of the station.
We were all satisfied with lots of beer and meal.(except one hasher
who kept asking everyone, Don't you fancy Shumai? Spring Rolls?
Or, maybe Sake? You know who it was ?!) After dinner,
we enjoyed Flash's temporary tatoo from Thailand.
Some sticked their favourite tatoo on their left up arm.
SL, who was having an interview the following day, preferred
his tatoo on his chest, but it seemed impossible due to
too much hair! At last, he put it on the side, which was less hair.
Flash got two tatoos on his both bottoms. Such a typical peaceful
Sunday evening, people in the restaurant were astonished at
our behaviour at first. Before long, one high-school boy
asked Flash to have one. I got a lovely tiny red rose on my
left arm. I felt like Akina Nakamori who was singing "TATOO."  I
should have been wearing a funny costume like a bath towel.
</P>
<P>
Still we were kicked out the restaurant, we spent about
one hour having DOWN-DOWN, taking photos in front of there.
Here is a fact for foreigners. They cannot squat down with
their heels on the ground. If they try to put their heels on the
ground, they fall on their back immediately. That's why
they are no match for Japanese style toilet.
When they use this type of toilet, they need to undress
as children do.
</P>
<P>
Do you remember 10 May was Mother's Day in Japan and USA?
Unfortunately, we had no mother harriette today, no one got
Mother DOWN-DOWN. Two American guys said they would give a call
their mother later. Did you?
</P>
<P>
Perhaps everyone wonder where the trophy is now.
I saw the head of it in Flash's bag.
</P>
<P>
P.S. Good luck for your new job, SL.

It was a Sunday afternoon with a murky sky and rain on and
off since the morning. And, there was dampness in the air.
There was a rumor that Bob, today's hare, had completely forgotten
that he was to be the hare. So, GFL was placed in the hare/co-hare's
position.  He explained how they had shared the job - 'I set the
first half of the trail and it will take 1.5 hours for you to run.
After that, Bob started to add his trail.  He hasn't come back yet.'
So, we all surmised 'today's run must definitely be long and we'll
have to run to the mountains.'
</P>
<P>
While we were preparing to run, Flash, who had to fly off to
Thailand on a  business trip that day, called by just to advertise
about the up-coming Red-Dress Run. But, all we prefered the
complimentary shampoo & rinse he had brought compared to the Red-Dress
Run advertisements!
</P>
<P>
We ran in the air of 100% humidity. At a check-point, in order to
draw an On-On arrow, Phuckwit borrowed a magazine & broomstick from
someone's garage without permission. Pig Porker borrowed a block from
a flower garden without permission too, because nobody had chalk.
(Down-Downs all round!  But thanks for marking...  S-L)
</P>
<P>
In about 1 hour, we got back to JR Ashiya and I was ready to
run Bob's course, however it was a complete 'On-Home'.
GFL had been lying!!
</P>
<P>
Anyway, everybody came back and we had the Down-Down Circle.
It was a very hot run before the setting-in of the rainy season.

Well, how do we start - maybe in the car, Sukebe's car,
driving up to Oyamachi, for those who may not know, the
location of Sukebe's summer house deep in the mountains
of northern Hyogo-Ken.  Slimie, the hare, had maps of the
area and wanted to set the course on his own - and that
he did - one of the better runs we've had up there in the
green green world with wonderful fresh air.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, we started off at about 4:30 - up to the ski area
where there was a CB and then down to the "hairpin" turn
where we usually turn right and up - a few of our Rambo
types - Phuckwit, C-M and Newt went up to find nothing -
a few of our more clever types had looked for flour/chalk
on the way up in the car and having found nothing, stood
around on the "hairpin" turn waiting and all took off down
the hill - past the summer house (I call this a Miso Horny
CB - Juso run two weeks ago - where the On-On is beyond -
way beyond what you expect).  Down, down to a left turn
off the road which lead to "Phuckwit's Tunnel" - he,
running ahead, purposly misdirected all of us through a
metal aquaduct, while he continued on the right course,
smugly yelling On-On!  We all ran down the same road,
caught him and continued through the village, further down
and turned left - the Rambo course - all of us up the
mountain - up, up - "ladies" down, down on their bums in
the mud, etc.  Finally came out and up another road
where we finally turned left again - up, up on some sort of
trail - out left and up another road - here the hare must
have lost his way (He did. Boy did he... S-L.) as there was
a CB about 2K up there - here, here was where the long trek
back to the start really began.  Phuckwit, as usual, running
down and gaining on all of us, back down past to where we
had come off the trail - where we found Ulysses and Mounted
(Kyoto hasher) just coming off the trail - both broadly
smiling and asking - CB? - which made them happy.
</P>
<P>
I noticed "P" had slowed a bit - to a nice pace - we passed
Beerhead, who was bitching and griping due to he had lost
the sole of his shoe and had missed the left turn altogether.
</P>
<P>
Now it was "crunch" time - "the shit was hitting the fan" -
whatta ya got left? - Phuckwit up front - Bobo, looking fresh
and cool passed me, and then C-M (looking a bit tired) but
running well and finally my old old buddy Snake Seaman - shit,
he passed me too!  Not far behind was Little Snake and Mother
Theresa and Futatabi (Kyoto hasher) - a great run - great
feeling - cold beer - ISN'T THIS WHAT THE HASH IS ALL ABOUT?
Thank you Slimie.
</P>
<P>
Down-Downs to almost everybody but maybe the best to Beerhead
who drank from his old shoe - beer coming out at where the sole
had been and various other places - we had to fill it up several
times in order to make it a "valuable Down-Down". Oh Beerhead
lost his sole, lost his soul - oh - we need a new hash song
about Beerhead losing his soul - well enough of this.  I'll
leave it to your imaginations on how the rest of the evening went.
</P>
<P>
<B>PS.</B>  Some time between 3 & 4 AM, Ulysses was wandering around
     with two cans of Sapporo looking for a "drunken partner"
     - finding no one awake he barged into the second floor
     sleeping room - crying "Who are you, who are you?" prior
     to collapsing on the sleeping bodies.

It was raining cats and dogs on the very happy day for Flash,
and I expected maybe only a few would show up due to this bad
weather. But No, many hashers were there at the exit of Tennouji
Station dressed in their own red! It looked Flash, Slimie Limie
and Beerhead were really outstanding. Ms.Wet T-shirts was also cute,
with a bandanna on the head and wearing a nice miniskirt. We were
in the center of all the people's attention and looked very funny.
</P>
<P>
We set off to the direction of Tennouji-Zoo, Tsutenkaku and
the trail led us to Namba area. It was raining continuously and
we all got soaked to the skin. We were all Mr. and Ms.WET T-shirts
actually. It was Sunday and around Namba, there were many many
people and we managed to find our way luckily. The highlight of
this trail was Mooning, of course. This time we had two Moon
checks!  One was done in front of famous 'Kuidaore' restaurant
and the other was done on 'Nanpa(Pick-Up)' Bridge. Here again
we were in the center of many people's attention.
</P>
<P>
Today's hare, Flash was running with us somehow and when we
got to Subway Shinsaibashi station, he said 'We take the subway
to Yodoyabashi'. So, we took the subway and some 'genki' hashers
remained on the road running. It was good that we had \200
in our pocket by Flash's advice at the starting point.
At Yodoyabashi station, we welcomed Silver Grey first, who was
as fast as our train. Wanda came in last, but a good job she made.
</P>
<P>
From Yodoyabashi we went on running to the north, direction of
Umeda and Nakatsu. Due to the weather of the day, the schedule was
changed, Beer-Garden was cancelled and now it was decided we
would go to Beerhead's place.
We arrived at the parking lot which is on the first floor of
Beerhead's apartment house. There we had a long down-down
ceremony drinking beers. It was getting colder by that time and
we are in the mood for going On-In place soon.
</P>
<P>
The On-In was at 'Ushinabeya', which is a good joint where
beef is served in a special cooking style. There we met Hand-Job's
little sister for the first time. For me, the sisters looked a
little different, but the little sister's way of talking was
just like the same as Hand-Job. We ate and drank a lot, made a lot
noise and went home. It was luckey that by the time we left,
the rain had stopped completely. Bunter walked Ms.Wet T-shirts
to subway Umeda Station, having a good conversation just between
themselves. Good job for the day, everyone!.

Despite looking forward to the welcoming of three Åenew bootsÅf, your
scribe arrived for todayÅfs run nearly 30 minutes late.  Why?  Before I
try to explain, a question:  What is hash all about?  The pursuit of
happiness gained through running and drinking, I understand.  Well who
says these activities need to be done in that order?  And what better
way of taking care of a hangover is there than sweating it out on a run
- especially if youÅfre still half shit-faced having crawled out the
last bar at 6am?  So sake-breathed greetings were made to Hare Wanda,
and almost half the pack - stalwart KFMH3 runners Snake Seaman and
Chinko-Manko.  Remainder of todayÅfs pack (ho hum, summer vacations are
here - sayonara teachers!) were virgins Andy from England, now living in
Nara, and Shiraki-san from Itami.  Third nu-be didnÅft show.  Reputedly
already a hasher, perhaps he dispensed with the first pursuit altogether
and stayed with the second?  A smart move, IÅfd say, coming close to
hurling breakfast in the first 100m.
</P>
<P>
By 3:40 our Moon-Master, Get Fuckin' Lost still hadnÅft shown up, and since it was
reported he was cycling to the start (a distance of about 3K, mainly
East), we figured he was probably on the outskirts of Himeji by now (a
distance of about 30K, mainly West), so took off without him.  Closely
followed by Wanda on her bicycle, whoÅfd remembered sheÅfd forgotten to
write a ÅeMoon CheckÅf on the trail.  Down Down!
</P>
<P>
The trail zigzagged mainly West before heading North to the first check.
  Being thin on the ground, new boot Andy checked straight while Snake
looked right and I tried not to decorate left.  Chinko meanwhile was
bringing up the rear with our other nu-be.  On-On turned out to be
straight, while Seaman enjoyed re-visiting the first part of the trail
on a loop, and I found nothing.  This pretty much set the pattern for
the rest of the run - beginnerÅfs luck or have we got ourselves a new
 ÅenaturalÅf hasher here?
</P>
<P>
A further 1k up the trail and we meet a
beaming Wanda at the Moon Check.  It was situated in a small wood, and
since there was nobody around to offend (the rest of the pack refused to
drop 'em in front of two obasans due to the absence of nearby
paramedics), the hare hung around to stand in.  I think that was her
excuse, anyway.
</P>
<P>
Next check was again sussed by Andy while I crawled
around a parking lot trying to look under cars that no doubt hadnÅft
been there when the trail was laid.  No, I was NOT laying my own trail.
Perhaps it was a sign of my condition, but the next check was marked by
the time I got there.
</P>
<P>
The trail was now looping around to the East and
we ran past Mondo-Yakujin Temple, apparently dedicated to fish and the
highlight of todayÅfs run for obvious reasons.  (A clue for the
cranially challenged: A FISH called WANDA. Geddit?)  Andy decided the
level of the water in the pool needed raising, a defilement that earned
him a second Down-Down in the circle.  Claims he used the toilet, but if
he did that makes him the first rugby player IÅfve met who knows how to.
</P>
<P>
By now the pack had regrouped, but Shiraki-san was missing!  A quick
trot 500m back down trail revealed nothing, so gentlemen to the last, we
continued without her.  We arrived at the forth and final check
together.  Just as well, it went on for ever.  I was convinced I was
ÅeOnÅf and about to call (and notch up a third infraction, no On-On!)
when I found CB - with another route from the check coming in from the
right.  Which we all visited again later, thanks to an early call by our
enthusiastic nu-be.  Still, I guess 3 out of 4 ainÅft bad!  On-On was
eventually guessed by elimination, a written ÅeOn-OnÅf found (rats, one
less Down-Down!), and the welcome sight of ÅeOn HomeÅf soon after.
There we found Shiraki-san, having sensibly headed back on getting lost
between checks.  Or was that chunks?  Nice run, Wanda!
</P>
<P>
GFL it turned out, was still On-trail having run after arriving late due
to a puncture (must have been the tough northern-Hyogo mountains on the
way), so with your scribe standing in as Circle-Miester, Down-Downs were
dispensed as follows:  Wanda: Hare and adding ÅeMoon-CheckÅf AFTER
setting the run;  Shiraki-san: New Boot (refused, doesnÅft drink - then
poured softy on the ground since sacred vessel was apparently
contaminated. By <B>BEER</B>?);  Andy: New Boot and watering a fishy temple;
Seaman: Having the same (hash) name as a key player in a recent sports
event I know nothing about (goal-guarder for England or something?);
Chinko-Manko: Annoying estate-agents (realtors to my over-the-pond
readers) by thinking about moving apartments again (yeah, I was getting
desperate by now);  Me: I forget why, but it was probably for forgetting
something;  and finally GFL: For arriving late and... well, just being
there!
</P>
<P>
On-In was at the ÅeotherÅf Fujiya.  Pretty quiet, relatively, possibly
due to the average age of the rest of the patrons being a bit less than
half mine.  Is school out already?  Finally shocked them into stunned
silence with a beautifully harmonious rendition of ÅeSwing LowÅf before
heading On-home.
