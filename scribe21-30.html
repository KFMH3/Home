After running the city area of Takarazuka, the pack went through many
tunnels which had been abandoned by the Japanese Railroad Co. In one of
them, the Hash unexpectedly saw the full moon. The P.H.M. was emitting
a lovely warm golden glow with hundreds of stars.

<B>The Point of Appreciation</B>
<P>
Try to imagine the mood of the Hash after running through a congested
city for a good 30 minutes and then up into the mountains and through several
long cold pitch black tunnels. While the pack was navigating one particular
long dark tunnel, it spied a faint glow up ahead. As the runners one-by-one
approached the source of the illumination, they realized it was time for
the obligatory mooning. And they did it.

Approximately 18 runners showed up and the group set out 15 minutes
late. After traveling along Shukugawa river upstream for about 15 minutes
the trail turned into a hiking course. After finishing this not-so-steep
part, the hash made it's way uphill on a normal road and then to a temple.
Everyone couldn't help but walk at this point, but we all managed to continue
on our way. Some of us had to quench our thirsts with water from a shrine
soon afterwards due to it being such a hot day. Next came Mt.Kannon --
approximately 600 meters uphill. This scribe took time to catch his breath
while taking in the course down below and waiting for the other hashers
upon reaching the summit. Looking at the map Yokozuna left at the station
for us, I noticed we had only finished what appeared to be 1/3 of the course.
The trail continued going up and down moderate hills for some time, and
I got trapped in a moderate CB before arriving at Okuike. A vending machine
on my left side! Oh no ....nothing in my pocket! Must continue &quot;On
On&quot;. No other hashers could be heard in the distance. Who was going
to help relieve my sense of fear to quench my thirst and empty stomach.
Must continue &quot;On On&quot;. I quenched my thirst with spring water
on the way, and swiveled my way down a river and upon passing through a
campground ... The Yokozuna! What is this guy doing? He's the hare and
it's now ‚S 1/2 hours since he started setting the course at 9:00a.m.!
I took over setting the Hare's course and was urged on to proceed to Dr.Sukebe's
house where the On On was to take place. It took me some time to find the
hiking course back, but eventually made my way down a normal road to Dr.Sukebe's
... 3 hours for the fastest hasher! Definitely the longest hash I have
ever run.
</P>
<P>
Having a shower and a beer made me reminisce oh how great it would have
been to just go to sleep.
</P>
<P>
It had just passed 4:00p.m. when everyone finally finished the run.
Down Downs were given to many, including the hare, non-runners, and Mother
Theresa and 3 other hashers who took it upon themselves to finish by &quot;chariot&quot;
(a taxi!) from the station. Everyone satisfied their hunger pains from
not expecting to have to fast until dinner. During the On On, &quot;B..head&quot;
made sure that all hashers go to the roof with him. For what though? I
think he really wanted us to &quot;Moon the Moon&quot; even though a K
women's college dormitory was just in the back. The moon just wasn't out
so early and besides Dr.Sukebe was able to save face with the students.
Soon afterwards a terrible snore was heard from the vicinity of the drunken
&quot;B..head&quot;.

If you're not going to culture yourself, leave it to Super Slimey. Our
cultural hare led the usual pack, plus a crowd of virgin runners, through
all those spots we're supposed to have visited since they're all in our
own backyard. It all started along the Kamo River where 22 KFMH3 gathered
to find out what sites awaited them. I arrived on the scene to discover
that Triathlon Bob can swim, bike and run, but he can't follow the Emperor's
directions all the way to the start. Rather, in the name of true slacking,
sun worshipping and a Sports Illustrated addiction, he had settled down
on a stack of wood, joined by Gobshite, for some R&amp;R. Our group grew
and perhaps we might never have motivated if it hadn't been for our fearless
hare who came to collect us.
</P>
<P>
Back on track, we were off with the usual on-on no sooner than, finding
ourselves at a dead end surrounded by water, our shoes were off-off. Many
brave barefooted souls risked the water, rocks, glass, garbage and general
slime of the drainage area. Others forged right through shoes and all.
Next it was straight to the big river where, half way across, it was down-down
(with the pants, that is) for the moon check. We continued on through quaint
and quiet streets of Kyoto, were divided into wimps and rambos, hit a few
shrines and temples and even a philosopher's walk. It didn't take much
time for the pack to split up further. I thought our small group of runners
were the most lost until, true to form, Get Fuckin Lost showed up a while
behind us. From there KFMH3 proved you can do more along the river than
stare starry-eyed at your true love. Hashers love their down-downs and,
especially with all those virgins around, they did many.
</P>
<P>At last, on to the on-on where we once again endeared ourselves to a
local establishment. The cultural highlight?? When Super Slimey did a repeat
of the moon check in the bar to the shock and horror of a few women on
the other side of the room. Three cheers for Hash Culture!!! ON-ON!

Saturday night at midnight in Shinsaibashi. An unlikely venue for a
hash some might say, but then they don't know the Kinky Hash, ready 
for it anyplace, anytime.
</P>
<P>
A small but intrepid band of 9 hashers gathered to give Bobo a sendoff
before he heads off for Thailand. It was a &quot;Live Hare&quot; night
with Bobo setting off about 10 mins before the pack. Phuque a Wallaby soon
sprinted off and was the most likely candidate to catch him. Four more
plodded along in the middle, with Lug Nuts &quot;Power Walking&quot; (whatever
that is) as the rear guard. An injured Super Slimey watched over our bags
assisted by a newcomer who decided not to run on his first hash.
</P>
<P>
After 45 mins of the darkest and most deserted streets that Shinsaibashi
has to offer we reached the moon check outside a store of swimsuit clad
mannequins. Soon we were home and off to the On-On which proved to be Sam+Dave
2. henceforth to be known as &quot;The Junior High School Student Sweatbox
Disco&quot;. After an hour or so of mingling sweat with the future of Japan,
the old farts decided to weave off home - leaving Phuque a Wallaby, Super
Slimey, and Bobo (decidedly in their element) to party the night away.

After the barbeque, the beautiful sunset had stirred up KFM hashers'
poetic turn of mind so deeply that they composed <I>Haiku</I>, a Japanese 
seventeen-syllable poem. Some hashers are native English speakers and 
some are not. Enjoy Hash Haiku Harriers.
